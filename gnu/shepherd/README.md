# shepherd

## Installation

Installing shepherd is somewhat tricky at the moment, since you need to use a 
lighly patched version of kiss. Or, alternatively, use 
[kiss.el](https://github.com/echawk/kiss.el), which does not have the timestamp
issue that upstream kiss does.

`elkiss install shepherd`

## Switching to shepherd

You'll need to do some prep work before you can switch over to shepherd.
